## **What is TShark?**

**TShark** is the command-line version of Wireshark, a popular network protocol analyzer. It allows you to capture, decode, and analyze network traffic in real-time or from saved capture files. TShark is highly versatile and supports a wide range of protocols, making it a go-to tool for network troubleshooting, security analysis, and penetration testing.

---

## **What is Dumpcap?**

**Dumpcap** is a lightweight packet capture tool designed to efficiently capture network traffic and save it to a file. Unlike TShark, Dumpcap does not decode or analyze packets; it focuses solely on capturing packets with minimal resource usage. It is often used as the backend capture engine for Wireshark and TShark.
